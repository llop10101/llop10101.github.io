### Information Architecture

The website is organized to ensure ease of navigation and a seamless user experience. The information is distributed into clear sections, as follows:

1. **Header:** The header is the key, so it is big and well defined to get the attention.
2. **Homepage:** The landing page, fills the full screen, and includes the important information about me, it also has a profile picture but to avoid bias, it's my dog picture. 
3. **Navigation** A left bar with some representatives icons allows to go directly to the section you want.
4. **Sections** All the sections are properly separated by headers.

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme:** The color scheme I decided is the same I use for my zsh terminal [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) since it's minimal and keeps the focus on the important things. It's based on blues and greys with white, and some aurora colors for contrast, this way I can stand out the things that I want the reader to focus on.  
- **Typography:** It uses the Roboto typography to keep the minimalist design and make long texts readable.

- **Imagery:** The images are big and well related to what I'm talking about in each moment.

- **Layout:** Basic and well defined layout to avoid distracting the readers focus.

- **Interactive Elements:** The interactive elements have hover effects to give feedback to the user.

Overall, the design prioritizes simplicity, usability, and user engagement.
